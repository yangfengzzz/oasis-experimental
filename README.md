## Oasis-Experimental

Oasis-Experimental is experimental projects for [Oasis-Engine](https://github.com/oasis-engine/engine) which is a **web-first** and **mobile-first** high-performance real-time development platform. this project will try to make some extension for Oasis, most of which are experimental attempts. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of Oasis and do some pre-research on future development. Therefore, it is strongly not recommended to directly use the algorithms and interfaces developed in this project, because these algorithms and interfaces may be redesigned and fully integrated into Oasis in the future.

Current plan：

- [x] PhysX intergration：Collider，Rigidbody，CharacterController
- [ ] Soft Shadow
- [ ] Temporal Anti-Aliasing（TAA）
- [ ] Global Illumination
- [ ] Screen-Space Reflection（RayTracing）
- [ ] Real-Time RayTracing（RTRT)

It is welcome to raise issues or contribute to the webgl-based graphics engine, and you are also welcome to pay attention to Oasis' official repo and [milestone planning](https://github.com/orgs/oasis-engine/projects).
